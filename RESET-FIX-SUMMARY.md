# Fix for "Reset to Default" Button

## Summary of Changes

The following changes have been made to fix the issue with the "Reset to Default" button not updating the textarea with the default English rules:

1. **Fixed JavaScript Syntax Error in webviewProvider.ts**

   - Added proper spacing between the reset button event listener and the window event listener
   - This ensures that the JavaScript code is properly parsed and executed in the webview

2. **Enhanced getDefaultRules() in fileManager.ts**

   - Added verification that we're returning the true DEFAULT_RULES without modification
   - Directly re-imported DEFAULT_RULES from the module to ensure no cached/modified version is used
   - Added comparison to verify that the returned rules match the expected default rules
   - Replaced Indonesian comment with English version for better code maintenance

3. **Improved resetToDefault() in fileManager.ts**

   - Added more comprehensive logging to track the reset process
   - Re-imported DEFAULT_RULES directly from the module to ensure getting the original English version
   - Added additional verification steps to confirm the file was successfully updated
   - Used both async/await and synchronous file writing as a fallback

4. **Enhanced Webview Message Handling**

   - Improved the rulesLoaded message handler to verify content before updating the editor
   - Added explicit content length checks to prevent loading empty content
   - Ensured UI elements are always re-enabled after the operation completes
   - Added more detailed logging to trace the message flow

5. **Leveraged Existing Manual Reset Command**
   - Confirmed the "Force Reset to Default Rules (Fix)" command is correctly registered in package.json
   - Verified that manualResetToDefault function from fixReset.ts is properly imported and used

These changes address the core issues that could prevent the reset functionality from working correctly. The fixes ensure that:

1. Default English rules are correctly retrieved from the source
2. File writing operations are properly executed and verified
3. The webview correctly processes and displays the updated content
4. UI remains responsive and shows appropriate status messages
5. Multiple fallback mechanisms are available if primary reset fails
